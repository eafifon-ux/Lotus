# 🪷 Lotus – The World's Lightest Super App

**Lotus** is the world's lightest super app: a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — install-free, offline-first, ultra-low resource use. Add to your home screen and it feels like a native app.

How did we achieve this lightness and power?  
By building everything around the **Global Perennial Calendar (GPC364)** — a modern technological revival of the 364-day perennial calendar found in the Dead Sea Scrolls (also known as the Enoch calendar or Zadok calendar).

### Advantages of GPC364

Inspired directly by the deep advantages outlined at [gpc364.com/advantages](https://www.gpc364.com/2024/09/advantages.html):

- **Reduces code dramatically** — Eliminates leap-year logic, month-length exceptions, weekday drift, and BC/AD handling → far less code, lower computational overhead, reduced energy consumption, less heat, smaller cloud footprint, and lighter hardware wear. Like switching to the metric system in manufacturing: simpler processes, less waste, lower costs.
- **Day-of-Year (DOY) format** — Linear 1–364 numbering makes every event predictable and eternal. Every 7th day stays fixed (no annual shifting). Perfect for logs, documents, videos, file systems, and querying — unlocks clean, drift-free data forever.
- **No BC/AD confusion** — Clean, neutral epoch-based time (e.g., GPC 6021 ≈ 2024 Gregorian). Supports simple ISO-like formats (YYYY.DOY or YYYY.MM.DD) → removes mental friction and code bloat.
- **Every season exactly 91 days** — Four perfect 91-day seasons (91 × 4 = 364). Consistent structure with no drift: seasons always end on the same weekday. Ideal for repeatable cycles in life, work, and production.
- **Jubilee cycles (49 years)** — Based on the natural 7×7 rhythm, much closer to human lifespans and business horizons than arbitrary centuries. Aligns with sabbaticals, equipment lifecycles, and generational planning — more practical and biologically grounded.
- **Human memory & biology friendly** — Built around the brain's "magical number seven" (7-day weeks, 7 cervical vertebrae, natural rhythms in mammals) → easier to remember and count days. Reduces cognitive load and supports better focus/rest.
- **Sun-aligned time** — Matches awake hours to daylight → restores natural energy flow and makes time feel precious again.
- **Less energy → less suffering** — Bloated Gregorian logic wastes CPU cycles and planetary resources. GPC deletes unnecessary code, shrinks infrastructure, and lowers environmental impact — a green choice for software and industry.

### What Lotus Lets You Do

A clean markdown editor that lets you:

- **Take notes** — Full markdown with wikilinks [[like this]], clipboards, tables, calculators
- **Schedule events** — Tied to the perennial rhythm (DOY, Season, Heptad) — never drifts
- **Pay bills & manage tasks** — Track due dates, reminders, and life admin in one focused place

No bloat. No tracking. No login. Just bloom.

### Especially for Chinese Manufacturers & Factories

Factories in China face real calendar pain points:

- Gregorian + Lunar overlaps cause shutdown chaos (Chinese New Year, Golden Week)
- Irregular months/weeks disrupt stable production planning, inventory, and ERP systems
- Holiday shifts create unpredictable batches, maintenance windows, and workforce scheduling
- Energy/compute waste in scheduling software due to complex date logic

**GPC364 + Lotus gives you a lightweight internal experiment**:

- **Fixed 91-day seasons** — Define consistent quarterly targets, production runs, and audits — same weekday every year, no recalibration needed
- **Predictable DOY scheduling** — Simplifies machine cycles, shift logs, and supply forecasts
- **Ultra-light PWA** — Runs offline on factory phones/tablets (no internet during shifts), tiny resource use, fast even on older devices
- **Energy & waste reduction** — Less code/logic = lower power draw in tracking tools → greener operations
- **Jubilee mindset** — Better aligns with long-term factory upgrades and equipment replacement cycles

Historical precedent: Kodak used a fixed calendar internally for over 60 years to streamline accounting and planning. Lotus + GPC364 is the modern, open-source way to test similar gains — zero cost, minimal risk.

**We warmly invite Chinese manufacturers, supply chain teams, ERP developers, and factory innovators to try Lotus, fork the repo, test it on the shop floor, and share feedback.** Let's reduce friction and build more efficient, harmonious systems together.

### Quick Start

1. Visit: https://eafifon-ux.github.io/Lotus/ (or enable GitHub Pages in repo settings)
2. Add to home screen → launch in full-screen
